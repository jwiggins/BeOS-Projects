BeOS-Projects
=============

This is a small collection of programs that I wrote for BeOS.

* BeCheckPoint: A simplistic login manager
* BFIV (Big F^%$ing Image Viewer): An image viewer that uses a disk cache for large files.
* Jeepers Elvis!: A plugin centered video mixer
* Jellikit: An attribute editor for BFS file attributes
* Sketch: An Etch-A-Sketch
* TheTick: A news ticker replicant that was built to read proto-RSS feeds
